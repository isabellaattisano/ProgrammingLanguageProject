## *Project Overview*
In [Part One](https://github.com/isabellaattisano/ProgrammingLanguageProject/tree/main/Part%20One) of this project I used the JavaCC tool to generate a pure parser for my project language. 

In [Part Two](https://github.com/isabellaattisano/ProgrammingLanguageProject/tree/main/Part%20Two), I then modified the parser so that it would return an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) after a successful parse. This AST would then be passed to my interpreter, implemented using Java, for evaluation.
