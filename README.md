# Parser and Interpreter Implementation 

## *Additional Project Details*

Additional project details can be found on my website : [Project Details](http://localhost:8888/personal-website/projects/pl/pl.html)


## *Project Overview*
For this project, In [Part One]() I used the JavaCC tool to generate a pure parser for my project language. In [Part Two](), I then modified the parser so that it would return an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) after a successful parse. This AST would then be passed to my interpreter, implemented using Java, for evaluation.
